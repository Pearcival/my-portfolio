        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <h2>Who am I?</h2>
        <p>I'm Josh Pearce, a Software Developer from the UK.</p>
        <p>
            I started my career in tech 13 years ago, initially working in technical support.
            Unfortunately, this just didn't satisfy the creative urges within me. So, I embarked
            on a career in software development, deciding on Java as my language of choice.
            After an intense period of independent study, I acquired my first certificates, taking
            and passing the Oracle Certified Associate and Professional Java exams.
        </p>
        <p>
            Shortly after this, I started my first development role at BAE Systems, where I worked
            as a web developer. I did this for seven years. I know, a long time, right? Following this,
            I joined my current employer, Raytheon UK, in 2020, where I still work as a web developer,
            albeit I now spend most of my time in the cloud. I'm certified in both AWS and Azure.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've had many roles over the years, Developer, Senior Developer, Tech Lead and even
            management positions. I've acquired a working knowledge of several
            languages and technologies during this time. Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, NodeJS, React, MongoDB, Oracle
            SQL, MySQL, to name a few. I also have experience with DevOps tools, such as Git, Docker, build
            and deployment pipelines (YAML), Terraform, ARM, Cypress and more!
        </p>
        <p>
            I thrive in small, agile teams, but I'm equally at home in large teams working on
            applications with a longer product lifecycle.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm passionate about software development and strive to build creative and elegant solutions. Creating applications that solve real-world problems is my thing
            and if I can design something pretty at the same time, then great! I'm well aware that
            looks aren't everything though, and I do of course, design and architect my solutions with
            scalability, security and technical dependencies in mind.
        </p>
        <h2>My Interests</h2>
        <h3>Video Games</h3>
        <p>
            I know what you're thinking, "a software developer that plays video games, how clich√©."
            What can I say? I like what I like.
        </p>
        <h3>Sports</h3>
        <p>
            I love my sports, football, cricket and golf in particular, but I'll play pretty much
            anything... except for bowls, I just don't get that, and it's not for me. Sorry if I've
            inadvertently offended a bowls enthusiast there. It's nothing personal.
